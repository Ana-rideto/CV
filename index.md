#### 👋 ABOUT ME
Hi, my name is Ana, and I am 28 y.o.

I have always been fascinated by mathematics and problem solving. A few years ago, I realized that I wanted to be part of the cutting edge of IT development. Since then, programming has been my passion.

I can't stop thinking about the puzzle until I find the right solution. I always achieve my goals and work for the result. There are no impossible tasks for me.

My dream is to be a creator, not an intermediary. I want to influence the development of technology and be part of the future.

## 💬 Personal profile
I learned programming on my own, then through the Skillbox online course, with a tutor and as part of a mini-group with whom we developed several projects. 

The more complex problems I solve, the more I like it. I feel excited and motivated to learn the latest technologies. Therefore, I want to get into a team of strong specialists, from whom I can learn.
