# Daniel Pustotin

#### ABOUT ME
Hi, my name is Daniel, and I am 20 y.o.

I have been learning programming since I was a kid. Solving complex and unordinarily problems always attracted me. That is my passion. I cannot imagine my everyday life without trying out something new in my developer's career.

I love to lead the development process and control my teammates to follow the plan. Likewise, I am kind of perfectionist at this point. Everything should be done right and that is the only one possible option for me.

My dream is to create an innovative and revolutionary product. That must be my masterpiece.
